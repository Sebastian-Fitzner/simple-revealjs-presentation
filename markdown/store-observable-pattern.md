--

## Introduction

One of the best resources for JavaScript is <br>[Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/).

--

## Why patterns?

--

It is all about scalability, readability and a vocabulary to solve common problems.

> Patterns are not an exact solution. Itâ€™s important that we remember the role of a pattern is merely to provide us with a solution scheme.

--

## Typical problems in web applications are ...

--

- Asynchronous behaviour
- Communication between parts of the application
- Data Sharing
- ...

--

## How do we solve these problems?

--

By using patterns like ...

--

## Publish & Subscribe Pattern

--

## Observer Pattern

## Problems with these patterns

--

**Keep components loosely coupled while sharing data states is not as easy as it seems.**

--

**Furthermore you have to deep dive into the project to understand where the data is shared.**

--

**Moreover the developer decides which part of the application takes over a certain responsibility to modify the data.**

--

**The developer has to handle timing issues like binding events before publishing data by another event.**

--

**Open API can lead to an anti-pattern by using the pattern in a wrong way**

--

**To work with Pub/Sub systems needs conventions.**

--

**Data Mutation in components leads to different states and inconsistency.**

---

## Ownership of data

--

One of the main points you should ask yourself is:

**Which part of the application is responsible to modify and handle the data?**

--

That leads in general too a much cleaner application, because

1. Only one part is responsible to handle the data
1. Data sharing is accomplished by using this source

--

## Does that mean that a component can take over the ownership?

--

### Yes ...

You can do that by triggering actions which will be handled by the component.

--

### and no!

It leads to scalability problems, because now the component is responsible for things which are not covered by the component itself.

---

## Solution

**A centralized store as observable.**

--

The solution to solve a lot of issues is to use a centralized store which is an observable.

--

## What is an Observable?

```ts
export interface Observable {
    subscribe(obs);
    unsubscribe(obs);
}
```

You can check out the branch `pubsub` to see `Veams.Vent` in action and how we implemented it.

--

You can checkout the branch `store` to see the improvements by using a `Store` class.

## Current state of store implementation

--

### What do we have?

1. A centralized store
1. observer/store pattern
1. a simple data object
1. a simple update method to add or modify data

--

### Problems

It does not fit into real world scenarios, because it is too simple for now.

##### Think about ...

--

### ... different data objects in your store.

--

### ... the open api problem in the Observer Pattern.

--

### ... the behavior how you would modify the data.

--

Let's keep that in mind and take a look at the requirements in the new demo project.

---

## Requirements in the Demo Project

--

### Status Quo

In the beginning we had two components:

1. Giphy List
2. Metadata View

--

### Next Steps (Expectation from the client)



1. Now we need to add an editor bar to delete that list and update the metadata view.
1. Furthermore a click on a list item opens up a popup.


--

### Do we need a discussion?

Do you want to talk about how you would do it in current projects?

---

# Refactor the store

--

## Open API

We want to get rid of the open api.

--

### Delete `initialize()`

--

### Exclude ...

- `broadcast()`
- `data`
- `dataSubject`

--

## Support event dispatching ...

... instead of using the public method `update()`!

--

### Create a `dispatch()` method.

--

### Add a simple `switch()` to that method.

---

# Update components ...

--

## ... by using the new `dispatch()` functionality.

---

# Refactor data handling ...

--

## ... by using multipe subjects.

--

## ... by using a simple store structure divided in `ui` and `data`.

--

## ... by extending our reducer*.

> The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.

--

## ... by adding a `select` function.

The `select` function is responsible for adding an observer to a specific subject.

--

## Hints

- Do not forget `break` in `case`.
- Broadcast to observers by using the `id`.
- Do not change the internal state of the component without updating the store.

# Veams Store Plugin?

--

Sure, there is now a simple plugin available. See https://github.com/Veams/veams-plugin-store.

--

## Usage

--

### Plugin Usage

``` js
import VeamsStore from 'veams-plugin-store';
import rootReducer from './store/reducer';
import INITIAL_STATE from './store/app-state';
import subjects from "./store/subjects";

Veams.use(VeamsStore, {
    reducer: rootReducer,
    state: INITIAL_STATE,
    subjects: subjects
});
```

--

### App State Structure

``` js
export default {
	data: {},
	ui: {
		overlayOpen: false
	}
}
```

--

### Subject Structure

``` js
import {Subject} from 'veams-plugin-store';

export default {
	data: new Subject(),
	ui: new Subject()
}
```

--

### Reducer Structure

``` js
import {state, broadcast} from 'veams-plugin-store';

export default function rootReducer(action, payload) {
	switch (action) {
		case 'DATA_GIPHYS_LOADED_ACTION':
			state.data = handleGiphysLoaded(state.data, payload);
			broadcast('data');
			break;

		case 'DATA_GIPHYS_CLEAR_ACTION':
			state.data = handeGiphysDeleted(state.data);
			broadcast('data');
			break;


		case 'UI_OVERLAY_OPEN_ACTION':
			state.ui = handleOverlayOpen(state.ui, payload);
			broadcast('ui');
			break;

		default:
			return state;
	}
}
```
