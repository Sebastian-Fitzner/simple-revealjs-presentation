# Creative Prototyping

## Example: [Knappschaft](http://demo.aperto.de/presentation/KBS-CP/dev/#leistungen-vorteile)

--

## Expectation

- a prototype in a few days
- key features should be implemented (navigation, responsive)
- responsive

-- 

## What do we get?

- a design and wireframes

---

## Process (status quo)

-- 

### Preconditions
- 10 - 12 PT for implementation
- 1 - 2 developers (Sebastian, Uwe, David)
- 1 - 2 designer (David Senger, Christin GlÃ¼cks)
- 1 concepter (Franziska Ziedler)

-- 

### implementation phase
- design preview/review
- wireframes discussions
- key features are defined in process
- short coordination times

---

# How good does it work?

--

## Positive

- communication
- previews and reviews

--

## Negative

- Intervention from outside 
    - key features got changed
        - navigation, responsive => navigation, responsive, animation "story" with parallax effects (priority), design fully integrated, sub page 

    - more expected than possible
    - much stress

# How to handle upcoming creative prototype projects? 

--

1. Define the key features at the beginning 
    - This could be: responsive, main navigation, animation sets 
    - when done, check if the key feature is properly designed/wireframed
2. Prevent interventions
3. Minimize discussion meetings
