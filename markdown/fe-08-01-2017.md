### Accessibility

- PO: Wibke & Sven

We want to improve our code quality in general. That's why we decided to make Veams Components more accessible.

### Veams

- PO: Andy & Sebastian (you wanna join?)

#### Veams Components

With Veams 5 we brought incompatibility into all Veams Components.

But we fixed it in the last week, so every initial problem should be solved by now.
